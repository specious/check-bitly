# check-bitly

Check domains to find out if they are [Bitly](https://bitly.com) domains:

```
$ ./check-bitly.sh bit.ly j.mp red.ht amazon.com duke.com
✔ bit.ly is a Bitly domain
✔ j.mp is a Bitly domain
✔ red.ht is a Bitly domain
✖ amazon.com is not a Bitly domain
✖ duke.com is not a Bitly domain
```

Want to get one like that? See: [How do I set up a Branded Short Domain (BSD)?](https://support.bitly.com/hc/en-us/articles/230898888-How-do-I-set-up-a-Branded-Short-Domain-BSD-)
